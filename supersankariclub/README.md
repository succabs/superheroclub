# a simple database application for the superhero club members

This is a coursework for the second programming course at the university. It is a database program written in Java. You can add and delete new heroes and their powers, weaknesses and antagonists. The program also has a working searchbar. You have an option to save or load the database (saved on .dat files). I know the UI has flaws but this is an old project and I made it just to learn Java and Object Oriented Programming. I have no intention to touch this repo anymore.

Have not opened it in a while, but hope it works. At least you can see the code.
